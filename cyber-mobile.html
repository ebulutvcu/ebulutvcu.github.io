<h3>Target Student Population and Pre-requisites: </h3>

Our target population is a cohort of students from both VCU and VUU. The program will be open to students with all backgrounds with some prerequisites satisfied. These prerequisites include basic understanding in programming. Students can have a background not only in Computer Science, but also in other related fields e.g., Computer and Electrical Engineering, Information Technology. Our goal is to expose the students who would normally not have much chance to take such a class but have abilities and skills. This will increase the cybersecurity workforce in mobile (iOS) app development industry by leveraging more students to this area.

<h3>Timeline and Milestones:</h3>

The proposed program will be executed with a 10-week session in Fall 2023 follow up with internships in Spring 2024. Each session will be in person and will consist of 1 hour instruction and another 30-60 min self exercise and assignment completion. These sessions will occur on Thursdays starting at 4pm 
in VCU’s iMac Lab (E1224). <strong>We will admit 10 students in total</strong> to this program and they will be selected from VCU and VUU applicants. The sessions will start on Sept 14th. The details about the internships will be posted later.


<p>
The program is open to VCU and VUU students only. <strong>Please submit your application <a href="https://forms.gle/ghHizS3e4bz3pzit6">here</a></strong>. If the number of applicants is more than the total planned population (10), the selection will be done based on the information collected.  We will make sure the women and men are equally included, and minority and underrepresented students are given priority. The training program will be <strong>free</strong> to selected students. During the follow up internships, the students will also be provided stipends.
<!-- <font color="red"> Update: We received many applications from VCU thus the application is closed for VCU students. </font> 
If you are a VUU student please submit your application <a href="https://forms.gle/R9Pvyimk7dBcxSta6">here.</a> -->

<h3>Tentative Course Content:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Major Topics Covered:</strong> We will start with the introduction of basic iOS programming fundamentals and frameworks. These include
Swift basics using playground: variables, operations, loops, if statements, functions (ii) Object oriented programming, polymorphism, inheritance, (iii) Swift UIKit Framework: Tableview, and Collectionviews, (iv) ViewControllers and Segues, (v) Touches and Gestures, (vi) Core Location, CoreMotion, (vii) Web services, networking, data persistence.
</li>

<li><strong>Security Aspect:</strong> Once the essential iOS programming topics are covered, we will also introduce the topics for securing the data that the app manages, and controlling the access to the apps, using the iOS Security Framework. This framework provides services that can (i) establish a user’s identity (authentication) and then selectively grant access to resources (authorization), (ii) secure data, both on disk and in motion across a network connection, and (iii) ensure the validity of code to be executed for a particular purpose. It is also possible to use lower-level cryptographic resources to create new secure services, however, as this topic can be complicated for targeted student population, we will not include it during this training. 
</li>

<li><strong>Hands-on Assignments:</strong> Through the training, there will be assignments which will provide students be able to practice their knowledge. The assignments will generally focus on development of components of a specific app which may have security vulnerabilities. For example, we will look at (i) showing and hiding password fields, (ii) Accessing the private resources securely, (iii) Secure coding of Touch ID authentication and other Touch gestures, (iv) Avoiding Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks in HTTP (not secure) requests, (v) Preventing screen recording and capturing by attackers, (vi) Protection of keychain, (vii) Protecting data in files included in apps, and (viii) Detection of jail break devices to prevent compromising the app logic.

</li>

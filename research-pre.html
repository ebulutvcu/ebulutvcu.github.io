			<b>Rapid and Resilient Critical Data Sourcing for Public Safety and Emergency Response</b>
			<p>
In public safety and emergency response, the key for a successful recovery is on-time and reliable communication between the people reporting the incident and the emergency management authorities.  Recently, crowd sourcing applications have proven to be promising tools to gather information with tremendous participation from the crowd. In emergency scenarios, however, such crowd sourcing solutions should be robust and resilient as the network could be congested or the underlying cellular infrastructure is damaged or temporarily lost. This project addresses these challenges by introducing a novel framework that integrates various technologies and tools for modeling and operation of large-scale crowd sourcing-based emergency response systems.

<img src="./ov.png" class="rightfloat" width=250px></img>

More specifically, it investigates (i) large-scale critical data collection via a mobile app and management process to be used in the investigation of an emergency incident, (ii) near-real-time processing of the gathered heterogeneous data in a cloud computing environment for critical information extraction such as faces of people in the videos and photos, (iii) adoption of D2D-based communication as a complementary component to improve system resilience in case of congestion's and failures in network infrastructure, and (iv) utilization of Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) network slices as dedicated bandwidth for time-sensitive communication in emergency response as well as to enhance wide area resilience of the system.

			<b>Analysis and design of efficient routing algorithms in Delay Tolerant Networks</b>

			<p>
			Delay tolerant networks (DTN), also called as intermittently connected mobile networks (ICMN), are wireless networks in which at any given time instance, the probability 
  			that there is an end-to-end path from a source to a destination is low. This is caused by the high mobility and low density of
			the nodes in the network. 
	<img src="./d50.gif" class="rightfloat" width=300px></img>
This property makes the routing of messages in DTNs a challenging problem. The conventional solutions do not generally work in DTNs because they assume
			that the network is stable most of the time and failures of links between nodes are infrequent. 
Therefore, store-carry-and-forward paradigm is used in routing of messages in DTNs. When a node
			has a message but no connection to any other node in the network, it stores the message in its buffer and carries the
			message until it meets a new node that does not have this message. If the encountered node is assessed to be useful in
			the delivery of the message, then the message is transferred to it. Here the key point is how to select the next node that the message will be forwarded to. Should the message be forwarded or is it
			better to replicate it to increase delivery chance? 
			</p>
		
			<p>
			To solve the routing problem in DTNs in an efficient way, we proposed several algorithms with different techniques and goals.
			<ul type="square">
			<li><b>Multi-period spraying of message copies:</b> We modeled a multi-period
			spraying based routing algorithm. The goal is to minimize the average copy count used per
			message until the delivery while maintaining the predefined
			message delivery rate by the given deadline. 
			<img src="./multiperiod.bmp" class="rightfloat" width=300px, height=200px></img>In each period, some
			number of additional copies are sprayed into the network,
			followed by the wait for message delivery. At any time instance,
			the total number of message copies distributed to the network
			depends on the urgency of achieving the delivery rate by the
			given deadline for that message. Waiting for early delivery in the
			initial periods with small number of copies in existence decreases
			the average number of copies sprayed in the network till delivery.
			We found out the optimum copy counts necessary in 2- and 3-period variants of our algorithm and
			then we also generated an idea showing how the presented approach can be
			extended to more periods. We did an in-depth analysis of the
			algorithm and validated the analytical results with simulations.
			The results demonstrate that our multi-period spraying
			algorithm outperforms the algorithms with single spraying
			period. Check <a href="publications.html#ton">related paper</a>.
</li><p>

			<li><b>Utilization of mobility correlation between nodes:</b> In real life, the mobility of people (i.e. human held devices) are not
			random. Moreover, it is also reasonable to expect correlation between them. We analyze the correlation between the meetings of each node with other
			nodes and focus on the utilization of this correlation for efficient
			routing of messages. 	<img src="./haggle.bmp" class="rightfloat" width=300px></img>We introduce a new metric called conditional
			intermeeting time, which computes the average intermeeting time
			between two nodes relative to a meeting with a third node using
			only the local knowledge of the past contacts. Then, we show how
			we can utilize the proposed metric on the existing DTN routing
			protocols to improve their performance. For shortest-path based
			routing protocols in DTNs, we propose to route messages over
			conditional shortest paths in which the link cost between nodes
			are defined by conditional intermeeting times. Moreover, for
			metric-based forwarding protocols, we propose to use conditional
			intermeeting time as an additional delivery metric while making
			forwarding decisions of messages. Check <a href="publications.html#mass">related paper</a>.
</li></p><p>

			<li><b>Exploiting social structure and relations:</b> In addition to intermittent connectivity which
			impacts routing most strongly, we also analyze the effects of
			underlying social structure over the communication network. <img src="./socialspraying.jpg" class="rightfloat" width=250px></img>In
			a social network, nodes interact in diverse ways so that some
			nodes meet each other more frequently than others. We first propose a new network model to reflect the underlying
			social structure over the network nodes, then we study the effects
			of this model on the performance of multi-copy based routing
			algorithms. If source and destination nodes are in the same community, it may be a good strategy to distribute all allowed copy count (L) to the
			members of this community. However, if source and destination are in different communities, source needs to distribute these copies carefully to 
			obtain the optimum delivery delay. We did an analysis of delivery delay with different number
			of copies given to source’s community (Lin) and destination’s community (Lout) and found the optimum Lin and Lout values that give the minimum
 			delivery delay. Check <a href="publications.html#socialspraying">related paper</a>.
 

			<p>In another work, we also introduced a new metric that detects the quality of friendships between nodes
			accurately. Then, utilizing this metric, each node defines its community as
			the set of nodes having close friendship relations with itself either directly
			or indirectly. <img src="./friendship.jpg" class="rightfloat" width=250px></img>We also consider the indirect relations between nodes in a way
			that makes them relevant to routing. Then, we present Friendship Based
			Routing in which temporally differentiated friendship relations are used in
			forwarding of messages. We propose to use
			different friendship communities in different time periods of a day as a better
			way of handling temporal variation of relations than previous solutions.
			Simulations on both real and synthetic traces show
			that the introduced algorithm is more efficient than the existing algorithms. Check <a href="publications.html#friendship">related paper</a>.

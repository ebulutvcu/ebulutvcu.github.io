	<h2>Vehicle-to-Vehicle Charge Sharing Network</h2></center>

       
      <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>

Electric Vehicles (EVs) have recently received increasing attention, as they have the potential to provide a sustainable and eco-friendly transportation system. They can also help in realizing the foundation of smart and green cities of the future by injecting energy to the grid during periods of reduced production to balance demand. Due to such potential, recently many auto companies have launched different kinds of EVs, aiming at mass penetration and market dominance of EVs in the upcoming years. For instance, according to a recent study, 15 million EVs are expected to be on the roads by 2030. 

Due to such excitement and potential about EVs, there has been significant efforts from both academia and industry to accelerate wide-scale adoption by addressing some of the challenges, which may help boost EVs' usage further (e.g., increasing the limited EVs' driving range and the number of charging stations, decreasing time durations for charging and grid impacts). While each of these challenges is currently being addressed individually (e.g., new battery technologies, fast/ultra-fast chargers, wireless charging, infrastructure enhancement), such solutions come with certain barriers in terms of costs and practicality. To provide a cost-effective and practical solution, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) energy transfer can be utilized among EV owners. To realize such V2V energy sharing, this project proposes building a V2V Charge Sharing Network (CSN) by bringing together researchers from multiple disciplines and engaging municipalities (i.e., city Richmond), utility companies (i.e., Dominion Virginia Power), industry and non-profit organizations (Virginia Clean Cities).  The proposed V2V CSN will have three major components: </p>
      <ul> 
	<li>A compact bidirectional V2V charger</li>
	<li>A social network platform and app, which will allow matching of EV users for energy sharing</li>
	<li>A communication infrastructure between vehicles, which can function without Internet access</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Intellectual Merit</h3>
      <p>The overall merit of the proposed project lies in the design of the V2V charger, the CSN, and the communication infrastructure and analysis of EV users' behavior for V2V charging purposes. Specifically, this interdisciplinary research project will: (i) Design and implement a compact and portable bidirectional two-way buck/boost DC-DC converter to provide a proof of concept of energy transfer between two different battery pack of any typical voltage level in an efficient manner; (ii) Build an online social CSN that will connect EV owners for matching of suppliers to demanders and investigate different social and economical models on this CSN with actual EV owners and V2V chargers; (iii) Investigate spatio-temporal online matching of demander EV with available suppliers; (iv) Design novel real-time and delay-tolerant querying mechanisms to access the proposed CSN by exploiting the current DSRC communication standard for vehicles; (v) Design V2V authentication to start the charging process by utilizing a novel form of Diffie-Hellman key exchange among app users; and (vi) Evaluate the proposed communication system on a city-wide DSRC testbed and provide large-scale assessment through real-data driven simulations.</p>
     

      <h3>Broader Impacts: </h3>
<p>The proposed V2V CSN can revolutionize the way EVs supply their energy needs and help accelerate the penetration of EVs by consumers. The outcomes of the project can significantly impact the EV market at large and trigger mass adoption of EVs in transportation. Since the proposed system will charge batteries much faster and more efficiently compared to charging stations, spread to a broader geographical area, future smart cities are expected to be relieved from the problems of building new charging stations in terms of cost, location, labor and politics. The proposed smart connectivity mechanism among users will also benefit the utilities since this will provide a lifeline service to decrease stress on the utility grid via coordinating off-peak/distributed renewable charging of supplier EVs. Finally, evaluation plans on a Tuscaloosa city DSRC testbed will provide initial results towards a scalable implementation of the proposed system and understanding its impact on all parties. The proposed research has a significant community involvement, particularly in Richmond, VA, that will enable collaboration for low-cost smart solutions to increase the quality of lives of the city residents. In addition, the proposed energy sharing unit and app has the potential to be easily commercialized with the collaboration of Andromeda, which already has some experience in V2V charging. The project will bring DSRC and V2V charging concepts to the curriculum at different institutions and involve minority students through REU programs. </p>
